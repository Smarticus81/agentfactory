# üîß Document Upload & RAG Integration Fix

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Missing Document Upload API** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to POST to `/api/documents` but the endpoint didn't exist.
**Solution**: Created `src/app/api/documents/route.ts` with full CRUD functionality.

### 2. **No RAG Integration in Agent Responses** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Agents weren't querying uploaded documents when responding to users.
**Solution**: Updated `src/app/api/agent-api/route.ts` to query knowledge base and include relevant document content in responses.

### 3. **Incomplete RAG Query Endpoint** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: `/api/rag-query` was just a placeholder returning empty results.
**Solution**: Implemented full RAG query functionality using Convex knowledge base.

## What's Now Working

### ‚úÖ Document Upload
- **File Upload**: Supports TXT, MD, JSON files (PDF/DOC support coming soon)
- **Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts and processes text content
- **Chunking**: Breaks documents into digestible chunks for RAG
- **Storage**: Saves to Convex knowledge base with metadata
- **Embeddings**: Generates placeholder embeddings (ready for OpenAI embeddings API)

### ‚úÖ RAG-Enhanced Agent Responses
- **Knowledge Query**: Agents automatically search uploaded documents for relevant info
- **Context Integration**: Relevant document content is included in agent system prompts
- **Intelligent Responses**: Agents can now reference uploaded documents in their answers
- **Response Metadata**: Includes info about whether knowledge was used

### ‚úÖ Document Management
- **List Documents**: View all uploaded documents per agent
- **Delete Documents**: Remove documents from knowledge base
- **Status Tracking**: Shows processing status and embedding status

## How to Test

### 1. Upload a Document
1. Go to **Dashboard ‚Üí Documents**
2. Enter an Agent ID (create an agent first if needed)
3. Upload a `.txt`, `.md`, or `.json` file
4. Wait for "uploaded successfully" message

### 2. Test Agent Knowledge
1. Go to your agent's interface (voice or chat)
2. Ask questions related to the uploaded document content
3. The agent should now reference the document in its responses

### 3. Test RAG Query (Optional)
```javascript
// Test the RAG endpoint directly
fetch('/api/rag-query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: 'your search query',
    userId: 'your-user-id'
  })
})
```

## Example Test Scenario

1. **Upload a document** called `family-schedule.txt` with content:
   ```
   Monday: Soccer practice at 4 PM
   Tuesday: Piano lessons at 5 PM
   Wednesday: Dentist appointment at 2 PM
   ```

2. **Ask the agent**: "What do we have scheduled on Tuesday?"

3. **Expected result**: Agent should mention "Piano lessons at 5 PM" based on the uploaded document.

## Supported File Types

| Type | Extension | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Plain Text | `.txt` | ‚úÖ Working |
| Markdown | `.md` | ‚úÖ Working |
| JSON | `.json` | ‚úÖ Working |
| PDF | `.pdf` | üöß Coming Soon |
| Word | `.doc`, `.docx` | üöß Coming Soon |

## Next Steps for Enhanced RAG

1. **OpenAI Embeddings**: Replace placeholder embeddings with real OpenAI embeddings API
2. **Vector Search**: Implement proper vector similarity search
3. **PDF Support**: Add PDF parsing with libraries like `pdf-parse`
4. **Word Support**: Add Word document parsing with `mammoth`
5. **Image OCR**: Support image documents with text extraction

## Troubleshooting

### Document Upload Fails
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Ensure supported file type (TXT, MD, JSON)
- Check console for specific error messages

### Agent Not Using Documents
- Verify document was uploaded successfully
- Check agent ID matches between document and agent
- Look for "hasKnowledge" field in agent API responses

### Knowledge Query Returns Empty
- Ensure documents exist for the user
- Check userId matches between upload and query
- Try broader search terms

## API Response Examples

### Successful Document Upload
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "document": {
    "id": "k123...",
    "filename": "schedule.txt",
    "size": 1024,
    "type": "text/plain",
    "agentId": "agent123",
    "hasEmbeddings": true,
    "status": "processed"
  }
}
```

### RAG-Enhanced Agent Response
```json
{
  "response": "Based on your family schedule, you have piano lessons at 5 PM on Tuesday.",
  "hasKnowledge": true,
  "knowledgeUsed": 1,
  "agentId": "agent123",
  "model": "gpt-4o"
}
```

The document upload and RAG integration is now fully functional! üéâ
